# Comparing Song Audio Features to Rankings on The Billboard Hot 100

### Project Description

The central problem in this project is to utilise publicly available audio feature data to predict whether or not a song is likely to appear on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. Audio feature data and Billboard Hot 100 chart data for this project have been obtained from multiple sources and combined.

For this project, two main techniques will be employed, namely data mining and predictive analytics. First, data mining and knowledge discovery will be used to explore the data, cluster audio features, and determine correlations between audio features. Second, predictive analytics will be used to attempt to build a predictive model using the data. By utilising knowledge discovered during the data mining phase of the project, predictive analysis will be broken into sets clustered with similar audio features. It is anticipated that this segmentation will improve predictive accuracy and lead to further insights.
